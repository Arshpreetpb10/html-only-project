<table style="font-size:30px">
<tr><td>Kiyotaka is an inconspicuous and unobtrusive student, and while his grades are average (on purpose), he possesses a sagacious ability to read the emotions of people around him with pinpoint accuracy and either helps or destroys them.

He is well-versed in history as he has quoted many historical figures who are all well known for their intelligence. He tends to come up with ingenious and imaginative plans such as using the school rules so that he could obtain old test questions from an older D-Class student by paying him 15,000 points. He also used the rules and the purpose of points to bribe his teacher into stopping the expulsion of Ken Sudo.In fact, it is hinted by a select few that he could have easily been placed in a higher class like A-Class if he actually applied himself.</td></tr>

Kiyotaka saving Suzune from her brother</p><p> He appears to keep his word as he promised Airi Sakura that he would come to her aid when she needed it, a promise well-kept as he rescued her from a pedophiliac stalker. He also promised Suzune that he would get her to get to A-Class even though it was forced.[3] Kiyotaka put his plan into action by assisting Suzune which in turn sheds some of her cold nature and allow her to open up to others, which had partially worked as he helped her get mass popularity after the island survival test.</p></td></td>
<tr><td>It appears that part of his aloof and standoffish personality stems from his mysterious past that he doesn't speak to people about. He gives vague answers about the matter and shows a dislike for people who ask about it, seemingly getting angry after they ask. In his anger, he is more serious in his tone of speech as shown when he sternly told Suzune not to pry into his personal history.<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/youkoso-jitsuryoku-shijou-shugi-no-kyoushitsu-e/images/7/71/Episode_008-016.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200912171708 " width="938" height="600" alt="ERROR LOADING IMAGE: check your internet connection"><p style="font-size:10px;" align="left">Kiyotaka threatening Sae Chabashira</p>In his anger, Kiyotaka is not above threatening people as he refused to comply with Sae Chabashira's order for him to aim for A-Class after stating to have been asked to expel him at the request of an unknown person later revealed to be his father. During this moment, he said his dislike of being manipulated as he even resorted to threatening her and grabbing her by the collar, unafraid that she was a teacher who could have expelled him for assault.</td></tr>

He does not mind manipulating others nor concerning himself with sacrificing a pawn as long as they help obtain his goal. Because of this mindset and his actions, it is unknown whether he really cares for those he has befriended or if he just gained their trust to use them.</p></td></tr>

Kiyotaka showing his true nature to Kei</p><p>In the light novels, his personality is somewhat different as he displays more emotion even having comedic fashions though he appears to still carry on a serious mindset. He has an extreme sense of unflappability and is sangfroid during difficult times. He has never shown to be under any distress when faced with threat or danger but once, he was blatantly angry at Ryumen after his deplorable acts against Kei. He is the most astute student in his class, crafting plans even Horikita wouldnâ€™t be able to. Despite his abilities being leagues above others, he has no hubris but is lackadaisical about them.

It is shown that Kiyotaka can be very cruel for his personal gains, like when he set up Kei Karuizawa, in the Basement of the Cruise Ship, to be tormented by Manabe and her group, just so Kei would breakdown and become a pawn for him to use. Still, he is stalwart as he eventually did rescue her and made plans to comfort her after the ordeal as a learning point for her.

He is shown to be cautious of others as he doesn't fully trust Suzune even making plans for her possible betrayal. Despite that he still associates with her. Also, he decided to challenge Manabu to a race where he chooses to reveal some of his talents, which were in contrast to his concealment in the anime.

After the race, he is surprised to see he has gained new popularity and is depicted as a little more social as he made more acquaintances and bonded with them to use their first names. However, he sees some of them as pawns, but he seems to genuinely care about a few of the people he has befriended, meaning he may not be too entirely jaded in his views.</p></td></tr>

Kiyotaka attacking Kakeru in a rage.</p>This appears as the case since there are some of his classmates he refuses to manipulate for his own purposes, showcasing his moral side.The most prominent display of his care for his friends was when he got angry and attacked Kakeru Ryuen for bullying Kei Karuizawa. At this moment, Kiyotaka was truly enraged which is a contrast to his usual calm behavior and his anger even scared the usual conceited Kakeru and his followers.He also showed care to Honami Ichinose comforting her, by telling her that he was always on her side after her history was revealed, and to Arisu Sakayanagi by catching her fall when Tsukishiro interrupted their secret meeting and kicked her cane in the Special Building.

When he was blackmailed by his teacher with expulsion, he actually tried to put in the effort to reach A-Class. However, when he discovered that neither his teacher nor father have any leverage to use against him to for expulsion, he gave up trying to advance to that class while ignoring the vehement protest of his teacher.</td></tr>
