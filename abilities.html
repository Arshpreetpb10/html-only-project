Kiyotaka's School Record</p>
<body STYLE="font-size:30px;">Kiyotaka's past is showered in enigma, but brief glances has shown him to be extremely intelligent and perceptive since young. Other than his claims of participating in after-school activities such as piano, calligraphy, and tea ceremonies. It is unknown if he did any of these things. There is no currently existing information regarding his past before the entrance exam of the school. He is shown to have been a part of an unknown organisation in his younger years, though his tenure there and how he left is still unknown.
While Kiyotaka did attempt to make friends when he joined his class, his inexperience in social matters caused him to miss out in forming a group, inadvertently ostracising himself and becoming a loner. While he did find an associate in Suzune Horikita who was also left alone, he was put off by her dislike of friendship and uncaring nature towards others. He was also peeved at her individualistic and prideful nature. Despite his desire to live an ordinary quiet student life, he always finds himself helping people in their desperate times of need as shown when he helped Suzune avoid an assault from her older brother, helped Ken Sudo avoid expulsion twice and saved Airi Sakura from a stalker as well as gaining the latter's affections for him.</body>

Kiyotaka effortlessly avoiding a strike from Manabu Horikita</p>It is presumed that there is more to Kiyotaka than he lets on as during his encounter with Manabu Horikita a veteran blackbelt. Although Kiyotaka didn't attack, he was able to evade all of Manabu's strikes in the battle with relative ease and managed to deflect a calculated blow forcing Manabu to create distance between them. This action earned praise from Manabu, who inquired as to what fighting arts he practised but instead received an unconvincing answer in return, showcasing Kiyotaka's excellence in martial arts and evasive nature. The best fighters of the school Suzune Horikita, Manabu Horikita, Ichika Amasawa,Kakeru Ryuen and his group, all acknowledges and respects his fighting prowess in turn, they all rather stay in his good grace and not make him an enemy during physical confrontations.</body>

Kiyotaka Aynokouji</p>Kiyotaka is shown to be extremely intelligent as he intentionally scored exactly 50 out of 100 points for each subject on his entrance exams. He is even more intelligent than Suzune Horikita who holds the highest scores in his class and who would later force him to aid her in reaching A-Class. He is also a very skilled negotiator as he was able to secure old test answers from an upperclassman by using both Kikyō Kushida's charms and his deceptive nature. He further displayed this by overturning the expulsion of Ken by offering his teacher points while knowing it was within the school's rules and with Suzune's assistance, his plan succeeded, earning praise from his teacher.

He is incredibly perceptive and meticulous, where he is shown to be very accurate almost all the time since he was able to study the exact personalities in others as shown when he deduced Airi Sakura's fear of strangers.[4] He picks up on situations very fast as he deduced that Chihiro Shiranami was Honami Ichinose's admirer, that Airi was in danger of an attack by a stalker[3] and saw through Suzune's façade of being healthy as she was ill in the survival test.[16] He also knew Kakeru was still on the island during the survival test just from seeing a communicator that he had and picked up on Mio being a spy for C-Class and outsmarted her by sabotaging her camera and making sure she'd steal the leader card before making himself the class leader.

The greatest display of his intellect was when he figured out the plan of class 1-A and class 1-C during the same test. He was a skilled master in the art of manipulation, knowing which people were scheming and who he could use to get the game to run in his favour, eventually winning the test for his class. This incredible act surprised Kōhei Katsuragi and Kakeru Ryūen, who had a surefire way to win the test. Kiyotaka's plan earned him praise from both Suzune and Sae Chabashira who were both surprised by how the test played out and question why he tries if he doesn't want to advance.</body>

Kiyotaka and kei Studying</p>Although Kiyotaka prefers not to draw attention to himself and would much rather fade in the background, he possesses outstanding talents in his academics that can’t be hidden, which was seen when it was heavily hinted by the Student Council President and his homeroom teacher that he intentionally entered D-Class to hide his true talents. Kiyotaka even declined an offer to join the student council, to avoid more work, which showed he has great talent in the art of being inconspicuous, except for the few who happen to notice his talents. Most notably, Manabu Horikita, Honami Ichinose, Sae Chabashira, Suzune Horikita and Chie Hoshinomiya have all hinted that Kiyotaka is clearly the smartest student in his class and could have effortlessly gotten into the upper classes.

This appeared to be confirmed as Sae ordered Kiyotaka to start aiming to reach class 1-A immediately or be expelled for not applying himself, indicating he could easily accomplish it. His intellect has been shown to even surpassed that of the mindset and ingenuity of Kōhei Katsuragi who is considered the second smartest in the year level.[11] His actions in the survival test even caused Suzune to question what drives him since he has proven that he is more than qualified to be apart of A-Class. Sae was also amazed by his plan quickly pulling one over on the other classes even giving him praise.

In the manga, even with the limited results he allows himself to attain, under the watchful eye of Sae, she hinted that he might even be academically smarter than even Suzune with his suppressed showings, which is notable as she is exceptionally excellent in her academics. Suzune readily agreed with Sae's statement after seeing his entrance exams results, questioning if he got some questions wrong on purpose.[3] He was also able to come up with plans in a shorter amount of time that she would never be able to do so herself, finding herself depending on him for assistance numerous times.

Later, in a conversation with Kei Karuizawa, Kiyotaka states there isn't a single question he can't solve ever since he arrived in the school. This is especially remarkable as the school deliberately added questions from university level and above which the likes of the brightest student's minds such as Honami Ichinose admitted she couldn’t even understand what the question was asking and Arisu Sakayanagi failing to answer the questions in time.</body>
