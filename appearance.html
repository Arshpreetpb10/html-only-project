He is usually seen wearing a standard school uniform. Outside of school, he wears a white hoodie covering a green shirt with an orange stripe along with brown pants. He is also seen wearing a blue vest over a white shirt and brown pants. He has grown taller since his first arrival at the school.

This is somewhat confirmed as he has attracted the attention of many girls in his class, some of whom are even very popular. Kei, before she officially started dating him, said he is considered to be in the top 10 of the hottest boys in the entire school. Sato finds him hotter than even Yosuke Hirata despite being rejected by Kiyotaka.<br>

She noticed the immense muscular structure of his body and his arms, particularly his lower arms, and questioned if he did sports, to which he adamantly denied. The reason for this is most likely due to the extensive training he went through as a child in the White Room. Most of the time, he is shown to express a lackadaisical and idle look, which gives off an unconcerned attitude. This can be interpreted as indifference or a relatively passive demeanor to his peers. It is shown in a flashback, that even as a child he possessed a similar unmoving expression that he would keep until adolescence. Many see him as someone who is devoid of emotions as he has never once cried or smiled in their presence calling him abnormal.Appearance
Kiyotaka is a tall, dark-haired young guy with brown eyes and fair skin. He normally wears his standard school uniform in the series, but when he’s not at school, he merely wears a white hoodie over a green shirt with an orange stripe and brown slacks. He’s also spotted sporting a blue vest over a white shirt and brown jeans on occasion. Ayanekouji is said to be quite attractive, having a well-built figure. Which he may have acquired as a result of the intense training he had as a child in the White room, where his background is linked to painful events.
